## 🏆 Objective
Create a responsive timeline using HTML and CSS that displays events in chronological order. The timeline should adapt to different screen sizes, providing a clear and visually appealing layout on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🎯 Key Objectives:
- **Header:** A title for the timeline, such as "History of the Internet" or "Company Milestones".
- **Timeline Events:** A series of events, each with a date, title, description, and optionally an image or icon. Events are arranged either vertically or horizontally, depending on the screen size.
- **Responsive Layout:** On larger screens, the timeline can be presented in a two-column layout with events alternating left and right. On smaller screens, the timeline should stack vertically for easy reading.
- **Visual Indicators:** Use lines or dots to visually connect events and indicate the passage of time.
- **Footer:** An optional footer summarizing the timeline or providing additional information.
